# ModYaml

ModYaml is a Python module designed for advanced YAML configuration management, offering modular, flexible, and powerful configuration capabilities.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of ModYaml is to enhance YAML configurations by providing:

1. Modular configuration through file inclusion
2. Support for various file sources (local, remote, cloud storage)
3. Environment variable interpolation
4. Jinja2 templating support

These features allow for more dynamic, reusable, and environment-aware configurations.

## Syntax

ModYaml extends standard YAML syntax with the `!include` directive:

```yaml
key: !include path/to/another/file.yaml
```

The path/to/another/file.yaml can be:
A local file path
A URL (http, https, ftp, etc.)
A cloud storage path (s3://, gs://, etc.)


ModYaml uses fsspec (Filesystem Specification) to handle file access, supporting a wide range of file systems and protocols.

```yaml
database:
  !include configs/database.yaml
logging:
  !include https://example.com/logging-config.yaml
cloud_settings:
  !include gs://my-bucket/cloud-config.yaml
```

## Processing Stages
ModYaml processes your configuration in the following stages:

1. File Loading: The main YAML file is loaded, and all !include directives are resolved recursively.
1. YAML Parsing: The complete YAML structure (including included files) is parsed into a Python dictionary.
1. Jinja2 Templating: The parsed YAML is rendered as a Jinja2 template, allowing for dynamic content generation.
1. Environment Variable Interpolation: Environment variables are interpolated into the configuration.
1. Final Parsing: The resulting string is parsed again as YAML to produce the final configuration dictionary.

## Using Environment Variables
Environment variables can be used in your YAML files for flexible configuration and debugging. They are accessible in the Jinja2 templating stage.

Example:
```yaml
debug_mode: {{ DEBUG | default('false') }}
database_url: {{ DB_URL | default('localhost:5432') }}

```

## Debugging configs

It is possible to trigger the config flow processing debug to standard logger.
In order to do this, the following environment variables can be used:

```shell
export MODYAML_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
